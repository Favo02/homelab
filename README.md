# HomeLab

Configuration files for my homelab.

> Legacy config files can be found in [docker-compose](https://github.com/Favo02/docker-compose) repository.

The lab consists of a single machine running _Debian 12_ (on bare metal, no Proxmox or similar), with [service](./services/) running in _Docker containers_ and some [scripts](./scripts/) to automate tasks using _cron jobs_.

> [!WARNING]
> Running services and configurations may not always be up to date, as the setup is constantly evolving.
